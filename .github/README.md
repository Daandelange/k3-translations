```

## Setup

Add the following `section` to your blueprint.

```yaml
sections:
  translations:

    deletable: false
```

+ Using the default language switcher in the Panel breaks the display of the actions (delete, revert)
+ `revertable` option is not implemented yet
+ `uptodate` option is not implemented (maybe will never be)
